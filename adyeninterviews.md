![AdyenInterviews](assets/cover.jpg)

As with every skill, talent, and expertise, the more you do it, the better you’ll be at it. Yes, the old saying is indeed true: Practice makes perfect—particularly with job interviews. That’s why throughout your studies at HackYourFuture, you will have the opportunity to practice your interviewing skills with the HackYourFuture team and with recruiters and engineers at, one of our main sponsors. 

This repo is made for [students](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation/blob/main/adyeninterviews.md#information-for-students) to learn how to prepare for these practices and for [Adyen employees](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation/blob/main/adyeninterviews.md#information-for-interviewers) to learn best practices and get a better understanding of what we are trying to achieve with your help.

## Information for Students
Please go through the information below to make the most out of your Mock Interviews!

### What is a mockup interview?
A mock interview is an emulation of a job interview used for training purposes. The exercise resembles a real interview as closely as possible to help you understand what is expected in a real job interview and help you improve your self-presentation. 

### When are the mockup interviews with Adyen and what else should I know about them?
The mockup interviews will start together with the Node module and each student will receive a total of two social and two technical interviews. These interviews will last approximately 30-40 minutes and right after the interview, you will receive both verbal and written feedback on how you did and how you can improve further.

### How can I prepare for the interviews?
First and foremost, you should work on your [‘personal brand’](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand) and submit your CV as indicated [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand/blob/main/yourcurriculum.md). Next, check the [Interview Preparation Repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation) made especially for HackYourFuture students. Once you are done with all that documentation, look at the specifics of the mockup interview role [here](https://careers.adyen.com/vacancies/development/510980/frontend-software-engineer) or [here](assets/cover.jpg) if the role is offline.

Last but not least, check the written feedback you’ve been given before any new interview so that you are sure you improve upon the committed points. To HackYourFuture team will give you access to a doc that will include all the specific feedback from each of the 4 interviews.

### What is the scope of the Social Interviews and what kind of questions can I expect?
During the Social Interview (aka [the introduction meeting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation/blob/main/introductionmeeting.md)), the interviewer will want to get to know you and your motivation, see how you communicate technical and non-technical matters, and see for themselves if you really fit into their company’s culture. This interview usually feels more like a conversation than an actual skills test. While there is no fixed set of questions you can expect in any interview as every interviewer has their own approach, you can still prepare for [the most common non-technical questions for HYF graduates](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation/blob/main/nontechquestions.md). 

### What is the scope of the Tech Interviews and what kind of questions can I expect?
During the Tech interview (aka the [technical interview](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation/blob/main/technicalinterview.md)) you will most likely be asked technical questions about the curriculum in general. To prepare for this interview, we strongly recommend you go through [the most common technical questions for HYF graduates](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation/blob/main/technicalquestions.md) and have some projects or code ready to show and explain to the interviewer.

### Is there any other advice I should follow when preparing for interviews? 
Revise the content of the [HackYourFuture Values](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/values) and have some examples ready to show how they are helping you become a better developer!

### When and where will the interviews be?
Someone from the HackYourFuture team will share the available spots to book the mock interviews in your class Slack Channel. They will also share with you a specific Jitsi channel where the interview will be conducted. Once you take a spot be sure to add it to save the date in your calendar and please join the interview well in time.

### What if I cannot attend an interview that I already committed to?
Mock interviews should be treated as real ones, so we expect that you will take them seriously and commit to them. Having said that, if for any emergency you cannot attend, please let the HackYourFuture team know as soon as possible and ideally try to swap the appointment with another student so that we do not waste anyone’s time and assure we make the most out of this great opportunity!

Someone at Adyen will give you access to a Google Sheet which will include the Interview schedule, the interview videoconference link, a list of Social and Tech interviews (with answers), and links to the student’s CVs and Feedback Sheets. The interviewers, students, and the HackYourFuture organization will have access to this last document so that together we can help students become interview warriors! 

Please always remember to fill in this sheet during or right after the interview so the student can refer to it when preparing further. Your feedback is crucial for progress. While we expect you to be as constructive as possible with your feedback and to also be wary that this is most likely the first-ever interviews for our students, we also ask you to be critical and to challenge the students so that they improve as much as possible. Finding a job as a developer is not easy task and the better we help students prepare the better their chances to succeed at it!
