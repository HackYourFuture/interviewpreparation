# Interview Preparation

![InterviewPreparation](assets/interview.jpg)

Interviews for internships or junior jobs usually consist of several steps: Thiy will usually start with a phone or email conversation, and then through the following rounds, though not necessarily in this order:

[1. The introduction meeting](/introductionmeeting.md) <br>
[2. The technical interview](/technicalinterview.md) <br>
[3. The technical assignment](/technicalassignment.md) <br>
[4. Mockup interviews at Adyen](/adyeninterviews.md)

Some companies merge these interviews together, while others might split them over multiple interviews. While it can be daunting to approach an interview process when you don’t quite know what to expect, luckily there are ways to be prepared. 

Research, practice and preparation will give you a meaningful chance of success, and more importantly, the freedom to give the interview process your best effort.

In this repo we will go through the different types of interviews and offer you tips and tricks to be as prepared as you possibly can!

Prepare well and go get hired!
